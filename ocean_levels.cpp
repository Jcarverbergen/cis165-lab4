#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const double ANNUAL_RATE = 1.5;
    const int YEARS_5 = 5;
    const int YEARS_7 = 7;
    const int YEARS_10 = 10;

    double increase_5;
    double increase_7;
    double increase_10;

    increase_5 = ANNUAL_RATE * YEARS_5;
    increase_7 = ANNUAL_RATE * YEARS_7;
    increase_10 = ANNUAL_RATE * YEARS_10;

    cout << "Ocean level after 5 years: " << increase_5 << " mm" << endl;
    cout << "Ocean level after 7 years: " << increase_7 << " mm" << endl;
    cout << "Ocean level after 10 years: " << increase_10 << " mm" << endl;

    return 0;
}

Expected output:

Ocean level after 5 years: 7.5 mm
Ocean level after 7 years: 10.5 mm
Ocean level after 10 years: 15 mm
